# Undefined: 
* A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

# Viod: 
 * In function it performs its action but doesn't return any value.

 * e.g: function sayHello(): void {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}

* explaination: 
In this example, sayHello is a function that doesn't return any value, so its return type is void. When you call sayHello(), it performs its action (logging "Hello, World!" to the console) but doesn't give any result back to wherever it was called from.
